# Super-Bowl Prediction using a Random-Forest-Model

My goal was to predict the Super Bowl 53 winner using a simple random forest model. 

Lots of room for improvement & fine-tuning. More years can be used as well as reanalysing the significance of ELO scores in this model and accurately representing the effect of the Super Bowl on teams performances.

Another interesting addition would be more football metrics (sacks etc) as well as modelling in how teams set up their game plan depending on the opponent.

Data was originally sourced from fivethirtyeight.com and is available in the "Data" folder.

Obviously, this is a beginner model and should be treated as such - if you decide to take this to Vegas, you're on own your own!
